              <h3>WEDDING EVENTS</h3>
              <P>As the big day approaches, it's time to think about the smaller details of your wedding, like your programs.
                 Seriously, what do you write in those? Here's a little comparison to help you decide what to include in a wedding program to make it unique to you. 
                 Think of your wedding programs as playbills for a Broadway show. Not only are they fun keepsakes from the event, but they also give the audience (your guests) helpful insight into the performance (your ceremony). 
                 Read all about the essential details you should incorporate into a wedding program as well as some fun additions to entertain your guests.</P>

              <h3>ANNIVERSARIES EVENTS</h3>
              <P>You shouldn’t be celebrating work anniversaries five days or weeks after the event. If possible, you should be celebrating the day of or earlier (if you group work anniversary celebrations in some way.) You should keep all of these important dates on your office calendar so you can keep an eye on upcoming anniversaries.
      
                If you are a forgetful person, you might also want to make a pre-reminder about a month or two before each anniversary date. Setting a pre-reminder will give you ample time to work with their manager and get the perfect gift.</P>

              <h3>MUSIC EVENTS</h3>
              <P>Whether you’re promoting a tour or a series of events, having a smart link where people can view all ticket links in one place is a great way to boost ticket sales. Smart links also encourage people interested in a particular event to check out other similar events that they may not have heard of.
      
                Additionally, advanced smart link services like AmplifyLink typically have integrated analytics and insights. This means you can easily track which link is the most popular, and through which platform fans find your events. All this data will undoubtedly make it easier to make targeted marketing decisions.</P>
